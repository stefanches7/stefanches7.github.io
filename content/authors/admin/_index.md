I am contributing to the Life Science and Healthcare technology and research with ideas, code and initiatives.
I have a background in Bioinformatics and Neuroengineering, and currently work on driving AI-readiness of data forward.
I want to work on Organoid Intelligence, and I am passionate to walk the hard way of translating the basic academic research into businesses and applications.

In my free time I enjoy meeting new people and sailing, playing basketball and doing Taekwondo.
